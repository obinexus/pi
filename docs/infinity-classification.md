# Infinity Classification for π-Engine Violations

## Overview
This document extends the OBINexus π-Engine to formally classify violations as countable (C∞) or uncountable (U∞) infinities.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Countable Violations (C∞)
- Discrete, enumerable events
- Can be indexed: v₁, v₂, v₃, ...
- Example: Individual tribunal claims

### Uncountable Violations (U∞)  
- Continuous violation fields
- Cannot be fully enumerated
- Example: Systemic harm patterns

## Implementation
```c
// Add to src/infinity_matrix.c
typedef struct {
    ViolationType type;  // C_INFINITY or U_INFINITY
    double measure;      // Lebesgue measure for U∞
    int index;          // Index for C∞
} ViolationClassification;
