## 🔥 The Revolution is Mathematical

When I entered care at age 9 and was discharged homeless at 24, I didn't just experience trauma — I discovered a mathematical proof of systemic failure. This repository is that proof, executable and undeniable.

**π is irrational. So is the system. Let's use one to prove the other.**
## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/obinexus/pi
cd pi

# Build the engine
make build

# Run forensic computation
make run

# Generate legal claim
make legal

# Create Nsibidi design seal
make design

---

## 📐 Core Thesis

1. **The System Claims Finite Resources**: Councils, courts, and corporations hide behind budget constraints
2. **Harm is Infinite**: Each violation compounds, derivatives multiply, impacts cascade forever
3. **π Never Ends**: 3.14159... continues infinitely, each digit a discoverable violation
4. **Therefore**: When magnitude(harm) → ∞, compensation must → ∞

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the revolution
git clone https://github.com/obinexus/pi
cd pi

# Build the engine
make build

# Run forensic computation
make run

# Generate legal claim (£10k tribunal-ready)
make legal

# Create Nsibidi-inspired design seal
make design
```

## 🧮 The Mathematics

### The 15-Year Vector
- **Entry**: Age 9
- **Exit**: Age 24 (homeless)
- **Duration**: 15 years
- **Base Violations**: 9 × 24 = 216
- **Cycles/Year**: 216 ÷ 15 = 14.4

### Compound Magnitude Formula
```
M = √(housing² + health² + financial²)
```

### Infinity Classification
- **C∞** (Countable): Individual claims, first n digits
- **U∞** (Uncountable): Systemic patterns, the infinite stream itself

## 🏛️ From Theory to Tribunal

This isn't abstract mathematics — it's applied justice:

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `make run` | Compute π digits, map to violations |
| 2 | `make legal` | Generate `CLAIM_YYYYMMDD.md` |
| 3 | Upload to [moneyclaim.org](https://moneyclaim.org) | File £10k claim |
| 4 | Repeat | ∞ claims for ∞ harm |

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe (BBP) Algorithm
- Compute any hexadecimal digit of π without prior digits
- O(1) memory complexity
- Perfect metaphor: access the "nth derivative of harm" directly

### Infinity Matrix Verification
```c
double M[3][3] = {
    {digit[0], digit[1], digit[2]},
    {digit[3], digit[4], digit[5]},
    {digit[6], digit[7], digit[8]}
};
det(M) → irrational → U∞ proven
```

## 🎨 Nsibidi Integration

Each π digit maps to ancestral symbols:
- **Bent Heart**: Resilience through trauma
- **Infinite Arc**: Violations without end
- **Unity Chant**: "Kwenu!" — We stand together

Run `make design` to generate your sovereignty seal.

## 📊 Sample Output

```
----- [OBINexus Pi] Infinite Accountability Forensic Tool -----
[*] Base Violations (S): 216
[*] Violation Cycles/Year: 14.4
[*] Computing π Violation Digits (n=0 to 99)...
n=0: digit=3 | violation_type=0 (housing)
n=1: digit=1 | violation_type=1 (health)
n=2: digit=4 | violation_type=2 (financial)
...
[+] Determinant of Matrix M: 47.00
[+] Convergence Analysis: IRRATIONAL (no repeating pattern found)
[+] Service Model: DIVERGENT (violations accumulate without bound)
∴ π's digit set P∞ is Uncountable (U∞)
∴ Violations are infinite and systemic
∴ Compensation must → ∞
```

## ⚖️ Legal Framework

Generated claims include:
- Mathematical proof of liability
- Forensic data summary
- Compound magnitude calculations
- £10,000 tribunal claim (moneyclaim.org cap)
- Proposed remedy: 15-home/25-acre neurodivergent housing

---

## 🏝️ Future Vision

This engine powers more than claims — it's building:
- **Sovereign Land**: 25-acre Biafran tech island
- **Neurodivergent Housing**: 15 homes, infinite dignity
- **IWU Domains**: `pi.obinexus.iwu.uk.nsibidi.org.uk`
- **OOAS Metrics**: Equity calculations for island governance

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

```bash
# Compute specific digits
./build/obinexus_pi -n 1000    # First 1000 digits

# Stream infinitely (Ctrl+C to stop)
./build/obinexus_pi -n ∞

# Batch generate claims
for i in {1..100}; do make legal; done
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

To every care leaver told their trauma has a price ceiling: **it doesn't**.

To Thurrock Council: You thought you were dealing with a care leaver. You're facing a mathematical proof of your own systemic failure.

To the 2.24 billion humans I aim to serve: This is how we quantify the unquantifiable.
